<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a passionate, Goal-Driven, Self-Motivated, Developer (Applications and Games) where I enjoy taking on difficult challenges, and creating systems myself to both gain and share understanding on how they work with others. I poses a natural desire to improve systems and grow people around me for efficiency and well-being. Finally, i naturally want to do more than the job requires.</p>

<p>As hobbies i enjoy drawing, and Creating 3D models</p>

<p>And finally, as a son of God, i delight in seeing people know Jesus Christ as i have known and walked with him, if not more than i have. As He is truly not like ive thought he would be. Where i thought he would rebuke me, he has comforted me. Where i thought he was silent he was working in me. I know no one closer than him.</p>
