<h2>My top 3 movies + a series of all-time.</h2>

<h3>The Shack</h3>
<p>The most heart-healing movie ive ever seen, where it shows what it would be like to share a conversation with God would be like, and teaches a very meaningful lesson on forgiveness.</p>

<h3>The Chosen</h3>
<p>An excellent way to tell the Gospel of Jesus Christ in a surprisingly enjoyable way. Where the events are told through the unique perspectives of the 12 Disciples of Christ.</p>

<h3>Ready Player One</h3>
<p>A thrilling movie showing what one could do in Virtual Reality. Legit i would try it</p>

<h3>Avatar</h3>
<p>A stunningly beautiful sci-fi film where the main character fights on the side of very tall blue aliens to protect their land.</p>
